Rust contracts are generated from C# code located in the `cs` folder within this repo. They're generated by `RustContractWriter.cs` as part of the build, which you can trigger via:

```
dotnet build --no-incremental
```

We then have some end-to-end tests in the management client. These can be executed by first setting a the `TUNNEL_TEST_CLIENT_ID` to some valid AAD app ID, and then running `cargo test --features end_to_end -- --nocapture`. The first time you run the tests, you will be prompted to log in with device code authentication.
